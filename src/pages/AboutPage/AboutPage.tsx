                            Hi! My name is Ashley Yarbrough and I'm a full stack developer based in Canton, Texas, USA<br/>
                            <br/>Fluent in both ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸English and ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½Spanish.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I began my journey with website development in 2021, when I had just returned to Texas from teaching English in South Korea for 4 years. I began with an interest in Data Structure and Algorithms in Python. I quickly learned that my problem-solving skills were perfectly aligned for my Full Stack studies. I knew web development is what interested me the most. A good balance of being both creative and technical.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            
                        </p>
                        <p>As a full stack developer with experience working abroad, I have a diverse skill set and global perspective that allows me to bring fresh ideas and solutions to any project. As a Latina, I am also committed to increasing diversity and representation in the tech industry. I have a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development, and am constantly seeking to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies. I am excited to continue learning and growing as a developer, and am eager to join a team where I can utilize my skills and make a positive impact.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Iâ€™ve worked on a wide range of projects, ranging from creating a curated camping web app to a hybrid working management app.
                        </p>
